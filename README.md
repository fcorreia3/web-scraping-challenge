Web scraping homework

This homework was quite comprehensive and challenging. I think it is really important to understand all the processes involved, and I would need more support to make it work. As it is now, I know it's almost there, but I have no more time to wander on my own. Would be grateful for your feedback and any advice.
Thanks.
